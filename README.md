# Workflow
> A workflow created with Gulp taskrunner.

## Getting started
For using this Gulp workflow you need to have node.js, npm and Gulp (globally) installed.

Clone or download this repo into your folder.
Run the following command in the terminal

```sh
npm install
```
It will automaticly install all used dev dependencies.

Create your folder structure and edit te paths in the gulp-config.json file.
After you have setup the paths and created some scripts and sass files you can run the following command in the terminal:
```sh
gulp
```
This will run the default Gulp task which will watch your SASS and scripts folder.
